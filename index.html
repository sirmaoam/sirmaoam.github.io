        <h2>Problem Statement: Too many different platforms </h2>
          <p>
              The professors of UofSC actually use blackboard to post assignments, but there are some that post assignments on other platforms, and it makes it harder to find what assignments you have to do for each class. It would be a lot simpler if they had their assignments in one spot.

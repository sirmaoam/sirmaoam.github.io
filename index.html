        <h2>Problem Statement: Too many different platforms </h2>
          <p>
              The professors of UofSC actually use blackboard to post assignments, but there are some that post assignments on other platforms, and it makes it harder to find what assignments you have to do for each class. It would be a lot simpler if they had their assignments in one spot.

        <p>
          My Persona is a doctor and his name is Zan, and his quote is "you have cancer" mainly because he diagnoses people and that is a common line he has to say to the patient unfortunately. Doctor Zan was a medical student 2 years ago and he wishes for the younger generation to have easier access to grades and assignments.

        <p>
          The student (aka the doctor) needed to check his grades and upcoming assignments but the teachers don't use blackboard and each use different websites, so the doctor uses our app as it combines link for each website all together in one.
